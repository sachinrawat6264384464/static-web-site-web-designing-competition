                    <p>Blood clotting, or coagulation, is the body's natural mechanism to stop bleeding from an injured blood vessel. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets and clotting factors in the blood activate, forming a platelet plug and then a mesh of fibrin threads that traps red blood cells and solidifies into a clot to seal the wound. While usually temporary and dissolved after healing, abnormal or unprompted clots can form inside vessels, leading to serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonaryÂ embolismÂ (PE).</p>

                 <h3 class="feature-title">Cardiologist</h3>
                    <p>Medical fields like cardiology, neurology, pediatrics, and oncology are all specialized branches of medicine, yet each has a distinct focus. A cardiologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels ðŸ«€. This includes issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, and heart rhythm disorders. They perform procedures like placing pacemakers or stents but typically do not perform heart surgeryâ€”that's the domain of a cardiac surgeon.

                    <h3 class="feature-title"> Neurologist</h3>
                    <p>A neurologist specializes in disorders of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves throughout the bodyðŸ§ . They manage conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Unlike cardiologists, neurologists primarily focus on diagnostic expertise and understanding complex neurological pathways and do not perform brain surgery. A patient needing surgery would be referred to a neurosurgeon.

                <h3 class="feature-title">Pediatrics </h3>
                    <p>
Pediatrics is the branch of medicine focused on the health of infants, children, and adolescents ðŸ‘¶, from birth through young adulthood. A pediatrician manages a child's overall health and well-being, including developmental milestones, vaccinations, and the diagnosis and treatment of childhood illnesses. The core principle of pediatrics is that children are not just small adults; their bodies are still growing and have unique medical, physical, and emotional needs.

                    <h3 class="feature-title">Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease where high blood sugar levels result from the body not producing enough insulin or not using it effectively, leading to serious damage to organs like the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common form is Type 2 diabetes, linked to lifestyle factors such as excess weight and inactivity, while Type 1 is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas produces little to no insulin. Management involves healthy eating, regular physical activity, and, for many, medication or insulin to control blood glucose levels and prevent severe healthÂ complications.</p>
